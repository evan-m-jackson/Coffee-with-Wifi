# Coffee-with-Wifi

This web application keeps track of the coffee shops around my neighborhood and their wifi capabilities.  I used Python, HTML, and CSS to make this app.  Specifically in Python, I used Bootstrap on the front end and Flask on the backend.  There is also a csv file that keeps track of the list of coffee shops and the csv can also be written to when there is a new coffee shop to add.  Finally there is a requirements text file that lists the required versions of each program used for the app.
